# Facial Emotion Detection Using Deep Learning

This project detects human emotions in real-time using facial expressions captured from a webcam, powered by deep learning and computer vision.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Human emotions play a vital role in communication. However, machines often fail to understand these emotional cues. 
This project aims to bridge that gap by enabling a computer to **automatically recognize emotions** based on facial expressions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the FER-2013 dataset.

## 🌐 Real-Time Use Cases

- **Online Education:** Detect if a student is confused or distracted in virtual classes.
- **Mental Health Monitoring:** Identify emotions like sadness or anger for early intervention.
- **Retail Analytics:** Understand customer satisfaction by analyzing facial expressions.
- **Smart Surveillance:** Detect unusual emotional behavior (e.g., fear or anger) in public spaces.
- **Interactive Games:** Adapt game difficulty or content based on the player's mood.
